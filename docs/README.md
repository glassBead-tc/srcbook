# Srcbook Documentation

Welcome to Srcbook's documentation. This documentation uses `.src.md` files, which are a special format that combines Markdown with executable TypeScript code cells.

## About .src.md Files

The `.src.md` extension is integral to Srcbook's functionality:
- It indicates that the file contains executable TypeScript code cells
- It enables Srcbook's literate programming features
- It allows for interactive documentation with live code examples

## Documentation Structure

Our documentation is organized into several key sections:
- Core documentation (getting started, features, etc.)
- Advanced topics (TypeScript features, debugging, etc.)
- Testing guides
- Web app generator documentation

## Getting Started

To view this documentation in its interactive form:
1. Clone the Srcbook repository
2. Follow the setup instructions in the main README
3. Open the `.src.md` files in your development environment

For a static view of the documentation, you can browse the files directly on GitHub or visit our GitHub Pages site.
